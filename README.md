# 910 Programming Language
A general purpose, interpreted programming language written in C.

# Introduction
Low level programming has always been a place of interest with me. Consequently, I have been wanting to learn C forever so this is the project I have chosen to learn it. This is fun, simople project to help me learn C and better my SWE skillset. With that, I have decided not to develop this lanugage with any specialties or strengths. My goal is to make it as 'general purpose' as possible, while still achieving the status of being fully Turing-Complete. The name '910', comes from my college town, Wilmington, North Carolina, where the area code is 910. I thought that would add a nice personal touch :). Explore and use as you please, enjoy!
